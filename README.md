1. What is the name of your language? 
-	The name of my programming language of choice is R.
  
2. When/where was it created, and by whom?  Was it written to address a particular problem or need?
 
-	R was created in 1993 by Ross Ihaka and Ribert Gentleman, two statisticians from the University of Auckland in New Zealand.
-	It was developed to address the need for a free and open source software environment for statistical computing and data visualization. 


3. What did you need to do to install the language?
   
- Installed R Studio and all of the necessary dependencies.
  
4. Does this language come with a recommended programming environment? What is it? If not,
how did you pick the one that you'll be using?

- The recommended IDE is R studio, which is the one that I will be using to complete this project.
  
5. How do you run programs in that language?
  
- Via the run button in the toolbar.
- 
- In RStudio, go to File > New File > R Script.
This opens a new, blank script editor pane, typically in the top-left section of the RStudio window. Writing your code in a script file allows you to save and reuse it.

In the newly opened R Script (or directly in the Console if you prefer interactive mode)
Type print("Hello World!")

- Comments are denoted via hashes. (#)
